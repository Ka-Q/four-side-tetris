# Four-side-tetris
A small POC for a Tetris-like game where the pieces are stuck to the middle and the whole board rotates. Didn't end up being as fun as I had imagined, so I'm not going to continue this as a bigger project. It's a nice concept though so i made it public.

## Goal
There realy isn't one, since there is no score system. Lines are cleared when they span across the whole central square. 

## Controls
Arrows left and right move the piece left and right

Arrow up rotates the piece 90 degrees clockwise

Arrow down increases the drop speed

Spacebar is hard drop


D rotates the board 90 degrees clockwise

Below is an example of a cleared line, just to the right of the black central point
